They have also been popular for quite a lot longer than deep learning, so there is a more mature ecosystem of tooling and documentation around them.\n",

    "Most importantly, the critical step of interpreting a model of tabular data is significantly easier for decision tree ensembles. There are tools and methods for answering the pertinent questions, like: Which columns in the dataset were the most important for your predictions? How are they related to the dependent variable? How do they interact with each other? And which particular features were most important for some particular observation?\n",

It is likely that deep learning will be a useful approach in our example of collaborative filtering, as we have at least two high-cardinality categorical variables: the users and the movies. But in practice things tend to be less cut-and-dried, and there will often be a mixture of high- and low-cardinality categorical variables and continuous variables.\n",

    "> A: Here's a productive question to ponder. If you consider that the procedure for defining a decision tree essentially chooses one _sequence of splitting questions about variables_, you might ask yourself, how do we know this procedure chooses the _correct sequence_? The rule is to choose the splitting question that produces the best split (i.e., that most accurately separates the items into two distinct categories), and then to apply the same rule to the groups that split produces, and so on. This is known in computer science as a \"greedy\" approach. Can you imagine a scenario in which asking a “less powerful” splitting question would enable a better split down the road (or should I say down the trunk!) and lead to a better result overall?"

In that game, the chooser secretly imagines an object (like, \"our television set\"), and the guesser gets to pose 20 yes or no questions to try to guess what the object is (like \"Is it bigger than a breadbox?\"). The guesser is not trying to predict a numerical value, but just to identify a particular object out of the set of all imaginable objects. When your decision tree has more leaves than there are possible objects in your domain, then it is essentially a well-trained guesser. It has learned the sequence of questions needed to identify a particular data item in the training set, and it is \"predicting\" only by describing that item's value. This is a way of memorizing the training set—i.e., of overfitting."

The embedding layer helped the model to discover the meaning of the different levels of these variables (the levels of a categorical variable do not have an intrinsic meaning, unless we manually specify an ordering using Pandas). In a decision tree, we don't have embeddings layers—so how can these untreated categorical variables do anything useful in a decision tree? For instance, how could something like a product code be used?\n",

    "The short answer is: it just works! Think about a situation where there is one product code that is far more expensive at auction than any other one. In that case, any binary split will result in that one product code being in some group, and that group will be more expensive than the other group. Therefore, our simple decision tree building algorithm will choose that split. Later during training the algorithm will be able to further split the subgroup that contains the expensive product code, and over time, the tree will home in on that one expensive product.\n",

For binary classification and regression, it was shown that ordering the predictor categories in each split leads to exactly the same splits as the standard approach.

    "In 1994 Berkeley professor Leo Breiman, one year after his retirement, published a small technical report called [\"Bagging Predictors\"](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/bagging.pdf), which turned out to be one of the most influential ideas in modern machine learning. The report began:\n",
    "\n",
    "> : Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions... The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests… show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the procedure that Breiman is proposing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly choose a subset of the rows of your data (i.e., \"bootstrap replicates of your learning set\").\n",
    "1. Train a model using this subset.\n",
    "1. Save that model, and then return to step 1 a few times.\n",
    "1. This will give you a number of trained models. To make a prediction, predict using all of the models, and then take the average of each of those model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure is known as \"bagging.\" It is based on a deep and important insight: although each of the models trained on a subset of data will make more errors than a model trained on the full dataset, those errors will not be correlated with each other. Different models will make different errors. The average of those errors, therefore, is: zero! So if we take the average of all of the models' predictions, then we should end up with a prediction that gets closer and closer to the correct answer, the more models we have. This is an extraordinary result—it means that we can improve the accuracy of nearly any kind of machine learning algorithm by training it multiple times, each time on a different random subset of the data, and averaging its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2001 Leo Breiman went on to demonstrate that this approach to building models, when applied to decision tree building algorithms, was particularly powerful. He went even further than just randomly choosing rows for each model's training, but also randomly selected from a subset of columns when choosing each split in each decision tree. He called this method the *random forest*. Today it is, perhaps, the most widely used and practically important machine learning method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence a random forest is a model that averages the predictions of a large number of decision trees, which are generated by randomly varying various parameters that specify what data is used to train the tree and other tree parameters. Bagging is a particular approach to \"ensembling,\" or combining the results of multiple models together. To see how it works in practice, let's get started on creating our own random forest!"

Rather, we're very specifically asking, how sale price would change in a hypothetical world where only `YearMade` changed. Phew! It is impressive that we can ask such questions.

    "> : The introduction of information about the target of a data mining problem, which should not be legitimately available to mine from. A trivial example of leakage would be a model that uses the target itself as an input, thus concluding for example that 'it rains on rainy days'. In practice, the introduction of this illegitimate information is unintentional, and facilitated by the data collection, aggregation and preparation process.\n",

    "> : A real-life business intelligence project at IBM where potential customers for certain products were identified, among other things, based on keywords found on their websites. This turned out to be leakage since the website content used for training had been sampled at the point in time where the potential customer has already become a customer, and where the website contained traces of the IBM products purchased, such as the word 'Websphere' (e.g., in a press release about the purchase or a specific product feature the client uses).\n",

    "Data leakage is subtle and can take many forms. In particular, missing values often represent data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Jeremy competed in a Kaggle competition designed to predict which researchers would end up receiving research grants. The information was provided by a university and included thousands of examples of research projects, along with information about the researchers involved and data on whether or not each grant was eventually accepted. The university hoped to be able to use the models developed in this competition to rank which grant applications were most likely to succeed, so it could prioritize its processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeremy used a random forest to model the data, and then used feature importance to find out which features were most predictive. He noticed three surprising things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model was able to correctly predict who would receive grants over 95% of the time.\n",
    "- Apparently meaningless identifier columns were the most important predictors.\n",
    "- The day of week and day of year columns were also highly predictive; for instance, the vast majority of grant applications dated on a Sunday were accepted, and many accepted grant applications were dated on January 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the identifier columns, one partial dependence plot per column showed that when the information was missing the application was almost always rejected. It turned out that in practice, the university only filled out much of this information *after* a grant application was accepted. Often, for applications that were not accepted, it was just left blank. Therefore, this information was not something that was actually available at the time that the application was received, and it would not be available for a predictive model—it was data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, the final processing of successful applications was often done automatically as a batch at the end of the week, or the end of the year. It was this final processing date which ended up in the data, so again, this information, while predictive, was not actually available at the time that the application was received.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example showcases the most practical and simple approaches to identifying data leakage, which are to build a model and then:\n",

    "So far our approach to ensembling has been to use *bagging*, which involves combining many models (each trained on a different data subset) together by averaging them. As we saw, when this is applied to decision trees, this is called a *random forest*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another important approach to ensembling, called *boosting*, where we add models instead of averaging them. Here is how boosting works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train a small model that underfits your dataset.\n",
    "- Calculate the predictions in the training set for this model.\n",
    "- Subtract the predictions from the targets; these are called the \"residuals\" and represent the error for each point in the training set.\n",
    "- Go back to step 1, but instead of using the original targets, use the residuals as the targets for the training.\n",
    "- Continue doing this until you reach some stopping criterion, such as a maximum number of trees, or you observe your validation set error getting worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this approach, each new tree will be attempting to fit the error of all of the previous trees combined. Because we are continually creating new residuals, by subtracting the predictions of each new tree from the residuals from the previous tree, the residuals will get smaller and smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions with an ensemble of boosted trees, we calculate the predictions from each tree, and then add them all together. There are many models following this basic approach, and many names for the same models. *Gradient boosting machines* (GBMs) and *gradient boosted decision trees* (GBDTs) are the terms you're most likely to come across, or you may see the names of specific libraries implementing these; at the time of writing, *XGBoost* is the most popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, unlike with random forests, with this approach there is nothing to stop us from overfitting. Using more trees in a random forest does not lead to overfitting, because each tree is independent of the others. But in a boosted ensemble, the more trees you have, the better the training error becomes, and eventually you will see overfitting on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not going to go into detail on how to train a gradient boosted tree ensemble here, because the field is moving rapidly, and any guidance we give will almost certainly be outdated by the time you read this. As we write this, sklearn has just added a `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` class that provides excellent performance. There are many hyperparameters to tweak for this class, and for all gradient boosted tree methods we have seen. Unlike random forests, gradient boosted trees are extremely sensitive to the choices of these hyperparameters; in practice, most people use a loop that tries a range of different hyperparameters to find the ones that work best."

    "We have dicussed two approaches to tabular modeling: decision tree ensembles and neural networks. We've also mentioned two different decision tree ensembles: random forests, and gradient boosting machines. Each is very effective, but each also has compromises:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Random forests* are the easiest to train, because they are extremely resilient to hyperparameter choices and require very little preprocessing. They are very fast to train, and should not overfit if you have enough trees. But they can be a little less accurate, especially if extrapolation is required, such as predicting future time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Gradient boosting machines* in theory are just as fast to train as random forests, but in practice you will have to try lots of different hyperparameters. They can overfit, but they are often a little more accurate than random forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Neural networks* take the longest time to train, and require extra preprocessing, such as normalization; this normalization needs to be used at inference time as well. They can provide great results and extrapolate well, but only if you are careful with your hyperparameters and take care to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest starting your analysis with a random forest. This will give you a strong baseline, and you can be confident that it's a reasonable starting point. You can then use that model for feature selection and partial dependence analysis, to get a better understanding of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From that foundation, you can try neural nets and GBMs, and if they give you significantly better results on your validation set in a reasonable amount of time, you can use them. If decision tree ensembles are working well for you, try adding the embeddings for the categorical variables to the data, and see if that helps your decision trees learn better."
